## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
>Just because someone isn't good at one aspect of life doesn't mean they're not amazing at others.
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
>As someone who is a PoC and growing up in Chicago, inner city, I have always been around many different races and ideas. This allows me to constantly reassess my implicit biases and ways reduce them.
* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
>Something that automates a lot of the processes while getting a few inputs. Knowing that not everyone has the same ability to understand information to ensure it's ease of use and accessibility across a wide variety of audiences. 

#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
 >I am a cis male PoC that have unintentionally benefitted from opressive systems. 
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
 >That systemic racism is a rampant disease and that I have a voice. This allows me to show that PoC do have a voice and repesentation matters. 
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
 >Just by knowing that intersectionality affects people in different degrees allows me to be more patient and empathetic of their situations. There is a bipoc climbing meet up group that helps amplify our voices and representation in a predominatly white male sport.
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 
>Being understanding and emphatic will help my active listening skills and help support voices that need to be heard.
